# Discord Webhook

This is an unofficial NPM package that allows you to easily send a webhook using the discord.js package.

> *The reason this is an unofficial is because it's not released to NPM. I may do it in the future if I get good responses from this.*

## Why using this over the discord.js function?

With this you are able to use the URL and it's overall easier.

## Examples

This code produces this output: *Note: as of the release there is no way to detect if the message has been sent successfully without looking at discord*

There should be no errors with this method if you do everything correctly. Documentions coming soon.
